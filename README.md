This is a little game that I made for fun in my free time. 

The game is runs in the console.

About the game:

 - Your goal is to kill the enemy!
 
 - You can move your "hero" with arrow left (to move left) and arrow right (to move right) on keyboard.
 - You can shoot the enemy with space bar on keyboard.
 
 - When you lost:
  - You can press "R" to Restart the Game with 0 points and 0 life.
  - You can press "Enter" to view your result.

Enjoy!
